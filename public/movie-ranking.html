        <h1>The Best Movies According to Andro</h1>
        <h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>
        <hr/>
        <h3>The God Father</h3>
            <p>A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.
            Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.
            Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.
            Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.
            If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.
            This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10.</p>
        <h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
            <p>In its Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written and directed by Frank Darabont, 
            after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King) was 
            nominated for seven Academy Awards, and walked away with zero. Best Picture went 
            to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were "just happy to be nominated.
            " Of course hindsight is 20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, 
            Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however, was 
            a success from the word "go," making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writer-director 
            an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. 
            Fortunately, failure wasn't a life sentence.</p>  
        <h3>Death Note</h3>
            <p>The story is unique. A notebook falls from the sky, and the human who writes a name in it 
                is capable of killing the individual pictured in his mind (I left out the details that you don't care about). 
                This presents the viewers with a highly debatable theme based on morals and justice. Yagami Light, who obtains 
                this power to kill, utilizes it in hopes of creating a utopia in which he is god. Criminals, and only criminals, 
                are to be punished in hopes of a perfect society. Is this however, right? Is it right to kill individuals who have 
                done wrong, and will do wrong again? Can they be reformed? Death Note presents the viewers with questions such as these, 
                questions which cannot be easily answers. This series challenges the viewers morals and for that, it deserves highly.</p>
